# "Night At Museum " project is part of Udacity's [VR Developer Nanodegree] program. We are supposed to research about the current trends of virtual reality in various sectors, other than games. I choose Healthcare industry as my concept and researched a lot about the things online. Collected images from google search and Videos from YouTube. This Project is very challenging and it is very helpful for me to implement the things what i learned in VR Developer Nanodegree.
